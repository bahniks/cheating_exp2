If I get into trouble, it is my own fault even if someone else told me to do it.
I make up my own mind about doing good or bad things.
I am just as at fault for breaking the rules when no one knows as when everyone knows.
I am the one responsible for my own behavior, good and bad.
I feel responsible for the consequences of my actions.
Most of the time I can tell how my actions are going to affect others.
In most cases, I can make my own decisions about what is right or wrong in a situation.
Sometimes it seems like fate determines whether my actions are good or bad.
Doing wrong is not really the fault of individuals when society enables them.
When things don't turn out as I expected, it seems like someone else took control of things.
Luck, more than what you do, is responsible for whether things turn out for the best.
If I feel pressured into doing something, I'm not as responsible as when I decide on my own.
No one can make me do something I know to be wrong.
My actions in most situations are based on what other people tell me is the right thing to do.
